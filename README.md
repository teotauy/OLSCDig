> **Status**: ✅ **FULLY WORKING!**  
> **Last Updated**: January 2025  
> Complete automation from Squarespace to PassKit with real-time management

## What This Does

Complete Liverpool OLSC member management system:

1. **🛒 Squarespace → PassKit Automation** - New memberships automatically create PassKit members and send welcome emails
2. **👤 Web-Based Member Addition** - Add members through a secure web interface (password protected)
3. **📱 Scan members in** - Use PassKit Pass Reader app (changes status to `CHECKED_IN`)
4. **👀 View headcount** - See how many people are checked in (updates every 60 seconds)
5. **✅ Bulk checkout** - One button to check everyone out after a match
6. **⚽ Match Updates** - Automatic Liverpool FC fixture updates on all passes
7. **🔔 Push Notifications** - Real-time headcount updates via Pushover

## Quick Start

### Option 1: GitHub Pages Control Panel (Easiest)

Access the control panel from anywhere:
- **Control Panel**: https://teotauy.github.io/OLSCDig/control-panel.html
- **Read-only Headcount**: https://teotauy.github.io/OLSCDig/public/index.html

### Option 2: Local Web Interface

```bash
python3 app.py
```

Then open:
- **On your computer**: http://localhost:5000
- **On your phone**: http://[your-ip]:5000 (make sure you're on the same Wi-Fi)

**Features:**
- **Headcount Display** - Live count of checked-in members
- **Bulk Checkout** - Check everyone out with one click
- **Add Members** - Password-protected interface at `/add-member`

### Option 3: Command-Line

```bash
python3 checkout.py
```

Lists all checked-in members and checks them out after confirmation.

### Test Connection

```bash
python3 status_api.py
```

Verifies API is working and shows current member counts.

### Quick Add Members

**Option A: Web Interface (Recommended)**
1. Start the web app: `python3 app.py`
2. Go to http://localhost:5000/add-member
3. Login with your password (set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env`)
4. Fill in the form and submit

**Option B: Command Line Script**
1. Edit `quick_add_members.py` and add members to the `MEMBERS` list:
   ```python
   MEMBERS = [
       {
           "first_name": "John",
           "last_name": "Doe",
           "email": "john@example.com",
           "phone": ""  # Optional
       }
   ]
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 quick_add_members.py
   ```

**Duplicate Prevention:**
- Automatically checks for existing members before creating
- Searches through the most recent 500 members by email (case-insensitive)
- Prevents duplicate member creation
- Skips welcome emails for existing members
- Perfect for clubs with a few hundred members

## How to Find Your Computer's IP

**On Mac:**
```bash
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}'
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
ipconfig
```

Look for your local IP (usually starts with 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x)

### Daily Headcount Monitoring

Just leave the page open on your phone or computer. It auto-refreshes every 60 seconds so you always know how many people are at the pub.

## Troubleshooting

### Can't access from phone

Make sure:
- Phone and computer are on same Wi-Fi
- Firewall isn't blocking port 5000

```

### Need to restart

Just Ctrl+C to stop, then `python3 app.py` to restart.
