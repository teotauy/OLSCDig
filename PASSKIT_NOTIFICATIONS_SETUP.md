# PassKit Push Notifications Setup

## ⚠️ Important Note

**PassKit push notifications work differently than expected.** After testing, we discovered that:

1. **PassKit doesn't support bulk push notifications via API** - you can only send notifications by updating individual passes
2. **Push notifications are triggered by pass updates** - not by dedicated notification endpoints
3. **The current implementation updates passes with notification data** but may not trigger actual push notifications

## 🔄 Alternative Approaches

### Option 1: PassKit Portal (Manual)
- Use PassKit's web portal to send notifications
- Navigate to Members → Select members → Send notification
- **Pros**: Guaranteed to work, easy to use
- **Cons**: Manual process, not automated

### Option 2: PassKit Template Updates
- Update pass template with notification content
- All passes automatically update with new content
- **Pros**: Automated, reaches all members
- **Cons**: Changes template for all members permanently

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
- Use our web interface to compose messages
- Copy/paste into PassKit portal for sending
- **Pros**: Best of both worlds
- **Cons**: Semi-manual process

## 🛠️ Current Implementation Status

### ✅ What Works:
- **Message composition** - Web interface for creating notifications
- **Scheduling system** - Schedule notifications for future delivery
- **Member targeting** - Send to all members or specific groups
- **Message templates** - Pre-written notification templates

### ❌ What Doesn't Work:
- **Actual push notifications** - PassKit API doesn't support bulk notifications
- **Automatic delivery** - Requires manual intervention

## 🎯 Recommended Workflow

1. **Use our web interface** to compose and schedule notifications
2. **Copy the message** when ready to send
3. **Use PassKit portal** to actually send the notification
4. **Mark as sent** in our system for tracking

## 🔧 Future Improvements

- **PassKit API integration** when they add bulk notification support
- **Email fallback** - Send email notifications if push fails
- **SMS integration** - Alternative notification channel
- **Template system** - Pre-written notification templates for common scenarios

2. **Compose your message** using the web interface
3. **Copy the message** when ready
4. **Send via PassKit portal** or use alternative method
